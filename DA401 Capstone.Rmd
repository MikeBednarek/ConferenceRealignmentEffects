## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#load packages 


library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

#library(gridExtra)
```
##Importing Data
I imported the dataset from my files in R and renamed it as fbs_data2 to use it.
```{r}
#rename the data set
fbs_data2 <- DA401_Data_bs_data
```

## Cleaning Data
To run correlations I had to delete all rows that had NAs present in the data. Every school didn't have Total Academic Spending available for 2022 so I deleted that column since I wasn't it needed for my analysis. Then I could keep the 2022 rows since if I got rid of the rows with NAs all 2022 data would've been lost. 
```{r}
#clean the data to omit the four rows that are blank
#Using na.omit here took out all the data for 2022 for every school because schools don't have the total academic spending for 2022 available yet so i am going to delete that column since it's not really relevant for what I'm looking for and causing issues with analysis
#fbs_data <- na.omit(combined_data2)
fbs_data2$`Total Academic Spending (University-Wide)`<- NULL
#now I can use na.omit to get rid rows with NA values since the data can't be found elsewhere and the values aren't meant to be zeros either
fbs_data2 <- na.omit(fbs_data2)

```

## Column Creation
I started to create additional columns that could help provide analysis and run more accurate predictions. I created a categorical column for debt levels to see if that had any effect on finances and to analyze spending across teams with similar debt levels. I created a column that has the new conference affiliation for each school to compare spending across conferences or within the new conferences. Since the media deals are already reported for each conference for 2024 I created a column that has the media revenue for each conference. I created a column for projected travel increases as the distance in between teams has significantly increased and it will be hard to predict the increase just off previous years since the change is going to be drastic. Lastly I created a column for number of athletic teams a school has as that affects how much they spend to field those teams.


```{r}
summary(fbs_data2$`Athletics Related Debt`)

```


```{r}
#wanted to create a categorical variable for debt levels among schools to possibly run some analysis to see if that affects revenues

fbs_data2$DebtLevels <- cut(fbs_data2$`Athletics Related Debt`,
                           breaks = c(0, 47688420, 88725616, 107587278, 150367675, 445020000),
                           labels = c('Low', 'LowMedium', 'Medium', 'MediumHigh', 'High'))

##Running Correlations
Next I began to run correlation coefficients to see how certain columns were related to each other. 

```{r}
correlation1 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Total Expenses`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between Total Expenses and Total Revenues:", correlation1, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation2 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`, fbs_data2$`Athletics Related Debt`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between Total Revenues and Athletic Department Debt:", correlation2, "\n")
```


```{r}
correlation4 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Total Football Spending`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between total revenues and football related spending:", correlation4, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation5 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Athletics Related Debt`, fbs_data2$`Total Expenses`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between Total Expenses and debt:", correlation5, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation6 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Facilities and Equipment`, fbs_data2$`Athletics Related Debt`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between facilites and debt:", correlation6, "\n")
```



```{r}
correlation8 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Total Football Coaching Salaries`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between total revenues and football coaches salaries:", correlation8, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation9 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Total Football Coaching Salaries`, fbs_data2$`Donor Contributions`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between donations and football coaches salaries:", correlation9, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation10 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Total Football Coaching Salaries`, fbs_data2$`Athletics Related Debt`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between debt and football coaches salaries:", correlation10, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation11 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Institutional/Government Support`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between total revenues and government support:", correlation11, "\n")
```


```{r}
correlation12 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Total Football Spending`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between total revenues and football spending:", correlation12, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation13 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Facilities and Equipment`, fbs_data2$`Donor Contributions`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between Facilities and Donor Contributions:", correlation13, "\n")
```


```{r}
correlation14 <- cor(fbs_data2$`NCAA/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football`, fbs_data2$`Total Expenses`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between Total Expenses and Media Rights Distributions:", correlation14, "\n")
```

```{r}
correlation15 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Facilities and Equipment`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`)
#Print the result
cat("Correlation coefficient between Total Revenues and Facilities Spending:", correlation15, "\n")
```


```{r}
correlation19 <- cor(fbs_data2$`Student Fees`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`)

cat("Correlation coefficient between Total Revenues and Student Fees:", correlation19, "\n")
```

##Regressions and Preliminary Visuals
Next I ran some regressions and created visuals to analyze how variables are interacting and how they could be inputted into predictions.

```{r}
#linear regression to see if there is a relationship between spending on travel and revenue
Prep = lm(formula = `Total Revenues` ~ `Game Expenses and Travel`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(Prep)
```

```{r}
#create a scatterplot with the two variables above with the linear regression line plotted as well
plot (fbs_data2$`Game Expenses and Travel`, fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`, main = "Travel and Game Expenses vs Total Revenues", xlab = "Game Expenses and Travel", ylab = "Total Revenues")
abline(Prep, col = "blue")
```


```{r}
fball_coaching <- plot(fbs_data2$`Total Revenues`[fbs_data2$Year == 2022], fbs_data2$`Total Football Coaching Salaries`[fbs_data2$Year == 2022],
     main = "Total Revenues vs Football Coaching Salaries 2022",
     xlab = "Total Revenue", ylab = "Coaches Salaries")

```

```{r}
facilitydebt <- plot(fbs_data2$`Facilities and Equipment`[fbs_data2$Year == 2022], fbs_data2$DebtLevels[fbs_data2$Year == 2022],
     main = "Facilities vs Debt Levels",
     xlab = "Facilities Spending", ylab = "Debt Levels")
```

```{r}
coach_debt <- plot(fbs_data2$`Coaches Compensation`[fbs_data2$Year == 2022], fbs_data2$DebtLevels[fbs_data2$Year == 2022],
     main = "Coaching Salaries vs Debt Levels 2022",
     xlab = "Coaches Salaries", ylab = "Debt Levels")

ggsave("coach_debt.jpeg", coach_debt)
```


```{r}
te = lm(formula = `Total Expenses` ~ `Total Revenues` + `Total Football Spending` + `AthleticTeams`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(te)

conf_intervals1 <- confint(te, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals1)
```

```{r}
game = lm(`Game Expenses and Travel` ~ `Facilities and Equipment` + `AthleticTeams`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(game)

conf_intervals2 <- confint(game, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals2)
```

```{r}
facility = lm(`Facilities and Equipment` ~ `Donor Contributions` + `NCAA/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football` + `AthleticTeams` + `Athletics Related Debt`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(facility)

conf_intervals3 <- confint(facility, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals3)
```

```{r}
coach = lm(`Coaches Compensation` ~ `AthleticTeams` + `Donor Contributions` + `Total Football Spending` + `NCAA/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football` + `Athletics Related Debt`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(coach)

conf_intervals4 <- confint(coach, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals4)
```

```{r}
admins = lm(`Support and Admin Compensation w/Severance` ~ `Total Revenues` + `Facilities and Equipment` + `AthleticTeams`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(admins)

conf_intervals5 <- confint(admins, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals5)
```

```{r}
scholarship = lm(`Athletic Student Aid` ~ `AthleticTeams` + `Donor Contributions`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(scholarship)

conf_intervals6 <- confint(scholarship, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals6)
```

```{r}
revenue = lm(`Total Revenues` ~ `Total Expenses` + `NCAA/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(revenue)

conf_intervals7 <- confint(revenue, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals7)
```

```{r}
ticket = lm(`Ticket Sales` ~ `Donor Contributions` + `Corporate Sponsorship, Advertising, Licensing`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(ticket)

conf_intervals8 <- confint(ticket, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals8)
```

```{r}
donor = lm(`Donor Contributions` ~ `Coaches Compensation` + `Facilities and Equipment` + `Athletic Student Aid`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(donor)

conf_intervals9 <- confint(donor, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals9)
```

```{r}
ads = lm(`Corporate Sponsorship, Advertising, Licensing` ~ `Total Football Spending` + `Ticket Sales`, data = fbs_data2)
summary(ads)

conf_intervals10 <- confint(ads, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals10)
```

##Beginning Predictions
I started predictions by separating the data into training data from 2005-2018 and test data from 2019-2022. Then I capped the outliers to the upper boundary since outliers have a large effect on linear regressions which is what I am using to make predictions. This should help create more reliable predictions. 

```{r}
training_data <- fbs_data2 %>%
  filter(Year < 2019)

test_data <- fbs_data2 %>%
  filter(Year >= 2019)

##Running Predictions
I started to run predictions for the years of the test data using the linear regressions above for each column that has a significant impact on revenues or expenses. After the predictions were run I created a new data frame that has the predictions for each year for each school to compare results.


```{r}
#Identify each school by using unique
unique_school <- unique(training_data$Data)

#create an empty data frame for predictions
predictions <- data.frame()

#Loop through each school and build a total revenue prediction for each school for 2019-2022
for (data_value in unique_school) {
  train_subset_data <- training_data[training_data$Data == data_value, ]
  #Build a predictive model for the training data
  total_rev <- lm(`Total Revenues` ~ `NCAA/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football` + `Total Expenses`, data = train_subset_data)
  tickets <- lm(`Ticket Sales` ~ `Donor Contributions` + `Corporate Sponsorship, Advertising, Licensing`, data = train_subset_data)
  donors <- lm(`Donor Contributions` ~ `Coaches Compensation` + `Facilities and Equipment` + `Athletic Student Aid`, data = train_subset_data)
  sponsors <- lm(`Corporate Sponsorship, Advertising, Licensing` ~ `Total Football Spending` + `Ticket Sales`, data = train_subset_data)
  total_expenses <- lm(formula = `Total Expenses` ~ `Total Revenues` + `Total Football Spending`, data = train_subset_data)
  travel <- lm(`Game Expenses and Travel` ~ `Facilities and Equipment` +  `AthleticTeams`, data = train_subset_data)
  facilities <- lm(`Facilities and Equipment` ~ `Donor Contributions` + `NCAA/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football` + `AthleticTeams` + `Athletics Related Debt`, data = train_subset_data)
  coaches <- lm(`Coaches Compensation` ~ `AthleticTeams` + `Donor Contributions` + `Total Football Spending` + `NCAA/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football` + `Athletics Related Debt`, data = train_subset_data)
  admin <- lm(`Support and Admin Compensation w/Severance` ~ `Total Revenues` + `Facilities and Equipment` + `AthleticTeams`, data = train_subset_data)
  scholarships = lm(`Athletic Student Aid` ~ `AthleticTeams` + `Donor Contributions`, data = train_subset_data)
  #Filter the test data
  test_subset_data <- test_data[test_data$Data == data_value, ]
  #Make predictions for the test data and append the predictions to the new data frame created
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Total Revenues` <- predict(total_rev, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Ticket Sales` <- predict(tickets, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Donor Contributions` <- predict(donors, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Sponsors and Ads` <- predict(sponsors, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Total Expenses` <- predict(total_expenses, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Travel and Game Expenses` <- predict(travel, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Facilities and Equipment` <- predict(facilities, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Coaches Compensation` <- predict(coaches, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Admin Compensation` <- predict(admin, newdata = test_subset_data)
  test_subset_data$`Predicted Athletic Student Aid` <- predict(scholarships, newdata = test_subset_data)
  predictions <- rbind(predictions, test_subset_data)
}

print(predictions)

```

##Comparing the Results
I began comparing the predicted to the actual results to see how the predictions shaped out. I used summary statistics and mean absolute error to visualize how far off the predictions were. If the predictions are close, there will be a 2024 prediction below as a case study to see how future finances can be predicted.

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Total Expenses`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Total Expenses`)
mae1 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Total Expenses` - predictions$`Predicted Total Expenses`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae1, "\n")
```


```{r}
summary(test_data$`Game Expenses and Travel`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Travel and Game Expenses`)
mae2 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Game Expenses and Travel` - predictions$`Predicted Travel and Game Expenses`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae2, "\n")
```



```{r}
summary(test_data$`Facilities and Equipment`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Facilities and Equipment`)
mae3 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Facilities and Equipment` - predictions$`Predicted Facilities and Equipment`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae3, "\n")
```

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Coaches Compensation`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Coaches Compensation`)
mae4 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Coaches Compensation` - predictions$`Predicted Coaches Compensation`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae4, "\n")
```

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Support and Admin Compensation w/Severance`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Admin Compensation`)
mae5 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Support and Admin Compensation w/Severance` - predictions$`Predicted Admin Compensation`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae5, "\n")
```

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Athletic Student Aid`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Athletic Student Aid`)
mae6 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Athletic Student Aid` - predictions$`Predicted Athletic Student Aid`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae6, "\n")
```

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Total Revenues`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Total Revenues`)
mae7 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Total Revenues` - predictions$`Predicted Total Revenues`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae7, "\n")
```

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Corporate Sponsorship, Advertising, Licensing`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Sponsors and Ads`)
mae8 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Corporate Sponsorship, Advertising, Licensing` - predictions$`Predicted Sponsors and Ads`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae8, "\n")
```

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Donor Contributions`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Donor Contributions`)
mae9 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Donor Contributions` - predictions$`Predicted Donor Contributions`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae9, "\n")
```

```{r}
summary(test_data$`Ticket Sales`)
summary(predictions$`Predicted Ticket Sales`)
mae10 <- mean(abs(test_data$`Ticket Sales` - predictions$`Predicted Ticket Sales`))
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ", mae10, "\n")
```
## Visuals 
I created box plots to compare some of the predicted columns vs the actual values to see how they compared in a visual sense instead of just with summary statistics. 

```{r}
pred1 = predictions$`Predicted Total Expenses`
actual1 = test_data$`Total Expenses`
boxplot(pred1)
boxplot(actual1)
expenses_box <- boxplot(pred1, actual1,
        main = "Predicted vs Actual Expenses 2019-2022",
        ylab = "Total Expenses",
        names = c("Predicted Expenses", "Actual Expenses"))
```

```{r}
pred2 = predictions$`Predicted Total Revenues`
actual2 = test_data$`Total Revenues`
boxplot(pred2)
boxplot(actual2)
revenues_box <- boxplot(pred2, actual2,
        main = "Predicted vs Actual Revenues 2019-2022",
        ylab = "Total Revenues",
        names = c("Predicted Revenues", "Total Revenues"))
```
